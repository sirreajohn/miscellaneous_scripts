First is cleaning.\n\nFood preparation involves the entire spectrum of events - from obtaining to eating food - and most of the food that we get in raw form is not best to eat as is. So, the first step in food preparation is cleaning the food. The need for this is obvious for things like meats, which can contain harmful bacteria if not cleaned properly. In many cultures, including certain Jewish and Muslim dietary restrictions, meat is deemed unfit to eat if there's blood on it, so the cleaning stage is vital. There are reasons that cultures have such restrictions; they're based on rules for survival.\n\nCleaning is just as important for other ingredients as well, including natural fruits, vegetables, and grains. Most food products we consume today are not only grown commercially but are treated with pesticides or other chemicals to ensure the survival of the crop. These chemicals should be washed off of produce before consumption. Additionally, dust, natural bacteria, and trace chemicals from insects or birds can be found on organic produce."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.strip(data_clean, x = 'diet', y = 'prep_time', color = 'diet', title ='Vegan and non-Vegan prep_times')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.strip(data_clean, x = 'diet', y = 'cook_time', color = 'diet', title ='Vegan and non-Vegan cook_times')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.pie(values = data_clean['course'].value_counts().unique(), names = data_clean['course'].value_counts().index,title = 'distribution of indian dishes based on course')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.pie(values = data_clean['flavor_profile'].value_counts().unique(), names = data_clean['flavor_profile'].value_counts().index,title = 'distribution of indian dishes based on flavor')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"state_frame = pd.DataFrame()\nfor state in data_clean['state'].value_counts().index:\n    state_f = data_clean[(data_clean['state'] == state)]\n    if len(state_f['diet'].value_counts().values) == 1:\n        state_frame = pd.concat([state_frame,pd.DataFrame([[state,state_f['diet'].value_counts().values[0],0]])],ignore_index = True)\n    else:\n        state_frame = pd.concat([state_frame,pd.DataFrame([[state,state_f['diet'].value_counts().values[0],state_f['diet'].value_counts().values[1]]])],ignore_index = True)\nstate_frame = state_frame.rename(columns = {0:'state',1:'vegetarian',2:\"non-vegetarian\"})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Indian vegetarian dishes"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Vegetarian cuisine is based on food that meets vegetarian standards by not including meat and animal tissue products (such as gelatin or animal-derived rennet).

Most Western-world multicourse meals follow a standard sequence, influenced by traditional French haute cuisine. Each course is supposed to be designed with a particular size and genre that befits its place in the sequence. There are variations depending on location and custom. The following is a common sequence for multicourse meals:\n\nThe meal begins with an hors d'oeuvre or appetizer, a small serving that usually does not include red meat. In Italian custom, antipasto is served, usually finger food that does not contain pasta or any starch.\nThis may be followed by a variety of dishes, including a possible fish course or other light fare. The number and size of these intermittent courses is entirely dependent on local custom.\nFollowing these is the main course. This is the most important course and is usually the largest.\nNext comes the salad course, although salad may often refer to a cooked vegetable, rather than the greens most people associate with the word. Note that in America since around 1960, the salad course (usually a small, simple green salad lightly dressed) is served at some point before the main course. Sometimes, the salad also accompanies the cheese course.\nThe meal may carry on with a cheese selection, accompanied by an appropriate selection of wine. In many countries cheeses will be served before the meal, and in the United States often between the main course and dessert, just like in most European countries. In the UK, more typically the cheese course will follow dessert. Nuts are also a popular after-meal selection (thus the common saying \"from soup to nuts\", meaning from beginning to end).\nThe meal will often culminate with a dessert, either hot or cold, sometimes followed with a final serving of hot or cold fruit and accompanied by a suitable dessert wine."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### starter\nstarter is often the first course of a meal, served directly before the main course. Starters come in a wide variety and may be served hot (vol-au-vents, soufflés) or cold (cold cuts, pâtés). However, as part of a formal dinner, they may be served after the soup or the hors d’oeuvres. In this case, the starter is therefore no longer the first dish of a meal, but comes second or third in the sequence of courses. Hors d’oeuvres are smaller dishes than starters. They consist of a varied assortment of hot or cold food served at the beginning of the meal, to stimulate the appetite, without being too rich."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### snack\nA snack is a small service of food and generally eaten between meals. Snacks come in a variety of forms including packaged snack foods and other processed foods, as well as items made from fresh ingredients at home.\nTraditionally, snacks are prepared from ingredients commonly available at home without a great deal of preparation. Often cold cuts, fruits, leftovers, nuts, sandwiches, and sweets are used as snacks. With the spread of convenience stores, packaged snack foods became a significant business.\nSnack foods are typically designed to be portable, quick, and satisfying. Processed snack foods, as one form of convenience food, are designed to be less perishable, more durable, and more portable than prepared foods. They often contain substantial amounts of sweeteners, preservatives, and appealing ingredients such as chocolate, peanuts, and specially-designed flavors (such as flavored potato chips).\nBeverages, such as coffee, are not generally considered snacks although they may be consumed along with or in lieu of snack foods.\nA snack eaten shortly before going to bed or during the night may be called a \"bedtime snack\", \"late night snack\", or \"(mid)night snack\".\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### main course\nThe main dish is usually the heaviest, heartiest, and most complex or substantial dish in a meal. The main ingredient is usually meat, fish or another protein source. It is most often preceded by an appetizer, soup or salad, and followed by a dessert. For those reasons the main course is sometimes referred to as the \"meat course\".\n\nIn formal dining, a well-planned main course can function as a sort of gastronomic apex or climax. In such a scheme, the preceding courses are designed to prepare for and lead up to the main course in such a way that the main course is anticipated and, when the scheme is successful, increased in its ability to satisfy and delight the diner. The courses following the main course then calm the palate and the stomach, acting as a sort of dénouement or anticlimax."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### dessert\nDessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course usually consists of sweet foods, such as confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine or liqueur. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China and India, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.\n\nThe term dessert can apply to many confections, such as biscuits, cakes, cookies, custards, gelatins, ice creams, pastries, pies, puddings, sweet soups, and tarts. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness.

In the case of the five tastes, our tongue has specific sensory cells that can detect them, and they have a specific nerve path.

A pain signal is then sent to our brain by the nerves that transmit touch and temperature sensations.That being said, spiciness is a wonderful tool in the kitchen, and it’s still part of what makes up our sense of flavor.

You can use foods like coffee, spinach, kale, grapefruit juice, beer, endives, dandelion greens, broccoli, or radicchio to achieve bitterness.\nTo balance the bitterness, which is the more common pursuit, use sweet, sour, and salty foods.
